Hey guys, welcome to day 17 of 100 Days of Code. Now,

2
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:05,430
today

3
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,690
we're going to be focusing on how we actually create the classes that we've been

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,910
using in yesterday's lessons.

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,480
Today's final project that we're going to be building up towards is a quiz game.

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,460
So we're going to be able to create a true-false quiz,

7
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:22,260
and we'll be able to play the quiz,

8
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:25,110
answer the questions and keep track of score.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,560
But we're gonna be building this completely using Object Oriented Programming. We're

10
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:35,040
going to be creating our classes ourselves and then using the objects created

11
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,480
from those classes in order to build this game. And once you're done,

12
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:44,520
this is what you'll be able to create. Question one, A slug's blood is green,

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,760
true or false. True. Now,

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:51,090
if you want to have a play around with the final project to get a feel for how

15
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,690
it works,

16
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:56,550
then you'll find a link to this final version of the quiz game in the course

17
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,920
resources. But once you're ready,

18
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,610
then head over to the next lesson and we're going to get started by learning how

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:07,110
to create our own custom classes. So, for all of that and more,

20
00:01:07,230 --> 00:01:07,710
I'll see you there.
